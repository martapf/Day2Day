## What is Day2Day?

Day2Day is a task manager operating on Google Docs.
It's simple and it just works.


## How does Day2Day work?

Every day you write your tasks on a Google Docs the same way you see on the screenshot.

In order to mark the task as done, you only have to strikethrough your task. (Cmd + shift + x on Mac or Alt + Shift + 5 on Windows/Linux)

The script will be run automatically every weekday between midnight and 1am, will copy the uncompleted tasks from the previous day.
